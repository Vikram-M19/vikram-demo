Oral cancer refers to cancer that develops in the mouth, including the lips, tongue, gums, and the lining of the cheeks and throat.
Risk factors include tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption, HPV infection, sun exposure, and a family history of cancer.
While there's no direct hereditary link, having a family history of certain cancers may increase the risk of oral cancer.
Oral cancer is relatively uncommon compared to other types of cancer, but it is still a serious health concern.
Symptoms may include mouth sores, lumps or white/red patches, difficulty swallowing, persistent hoarseness, and unexplained bleeding.
Poor dental hygiene alone is not a direct cause of oral cancer, but it can contribute to an increased risk.
Diagnosis involves a physical examination, biopsy, imaging tests (CT scan, MRI), and sometimes a PET scan.
Treatment may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these methods.
Avoiding tobacco, moderating alcohol consumption, and practicing safe sun exposure can reduce the risk. HPV vaccination is also recommended.
Staging is based on the size of the tumor, lymph node involvement, and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Inhaling smoke or using e-cigarettes can still expose the mouth to carcinogens, increasing the risk of oral cancer.
Yes, oral cancer includes various types, such as squamous cell carcinoma, salivary gland cancer, and lymphoma.
Yes, oral cancer can be painless in its early stages, which is why regular screenings are crucial.
While men are generally at higher risk, women with specific risk factors, such as tobacco and alcohol use, are also at risk.
